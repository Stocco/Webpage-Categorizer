possible think layers Neural networks bottom re type computer architecture onto artificial intelligence built Machine learning next program might run neural network training computers look certain answers pots data deep learning top particular type machine learning become popular past decade largely thanks two new resources cheap processing power abundant data otherwise known internet The concept neural networks goes way back 50s beginning AI field research In nutshell networks way structuring computer looks like cartoon brain comprised neuron like nodes connected together web Individually nodes dumb answering extremely basic questions collectively tackle difficult problems More importantly right algorithms taught With conventional programming would give precise set rules telling look left right wait cars use pedestrian crossings etc let go With machine learning d instead show 10 000 videos someone crossing road safely 10 000 videos someone getting hit car let thing Over past couple decades people tried sorts different methods try teach computers These methods include example reinforcement learning give computer reward thing want gradually optimizing best solution genetic algorithms competing methods solving problem pitted one another manner comparable natural selection In today classrooms computers one teaching method become particularly useful deep learning type machine learning uses lots layers neural network analyze data different abstractions So deep learning system looking picture layer essentially tackling different magnification The bottom layer might look 5 x 5 grids pixels answering simply yes whether something shows grid If answers yes layer looks see grid fits larger pattern Is beginning line example corner This process gradually builds allowing software understand even complicated data breaking constituent parts Next let imagine want teach computer cat looks like using deep learning First d take neural network program different layers identify different elements cat claws paws whiskers etc Each layer would built layers allow recognize particular element called deep learning Then network shown lot images cats animals told This cat tell computer showing picture cat This also cat This As neural network sees different images different layers nodes within light recognize claws paws whiskers etc Over time remembers layers important aren strengthening connections disregarding others It might discover paws example strongly correlated cats also appear things cats learns look paws also appear alongside whiskers This long iterative process system slowly getting better based feedback Either human correct computer nudging right direction Or network large enough pot labeled data test seeing different weightings layers produce accurate answers Now imagine many steps needed say whether something cat think complex systems recognize well everything else exists world That Microsoft proud However deep learning proved adept tasks involving speech image recognition stuff lots commercial applications also plenty limitations Not deep learning techniques require lot data fine tuning work intelligence narrow brittle As cognitive psychologist Gary Marcus acquiring abstract ideas like sibling identical They obvious ways performing logical inferences also still long way integrating abstract knowledge information objects typically used In words common sense neural network used generate picture dumbbell trained sample images The pictures dumbbells produced pretty good two gray circles connected horizontal tube But middle weight muscular outline bodybuilder arm This pictures network trained often shown bodybuilder holding dumbbell Deep learning might able work common visual properties tens thousands pictures dumbbells would never make cognitive leap say dumbbells arms These sorts problems aren limited common sense either Because way examine data deep learning networks also These sorts limitations artfully hidden though Take new wave digital assistants like Siri example often seem like understand us answering questions setting alarms telling preprogrammed jokes quips along way But computer scientist Hector Levesque points quirks show big gap AI real intelligence Levesque uses points machines best challenge rely tricks make people think re talking human They use jokes quotations emotional outbursts misdirection manner verbal dodges confuse distract questioners And indeed machine said publications A better test AI domain says Levesque would quiz machines surreal logical questions demand sort wide causal knowledge Marcus describes Levesque offers example questions like Could crocodile run steeplechase Should baseball players allowed glue small wings onto caps Imagine sort things computer would know even attempt answer soon machines conquered task previously humans could whether playing chess recognizing faces longer considered mark intelligence As computer scientists Larry Tesler put Intelligence whatever machines haven done yet And even tasks computers beat aren replicating human intelligence When say neural network like brain true says LeCun It true way airplanes aren like birds They flap wings feathers muscles If create intelligence says won like human intelligence animal intelligence It difficult us imagine example intelligent entity impulse towards self preservation Many people working within field AI dismissive idea ll ever able create artificial intelligence truly sentient There approach moment hope flexible performing multiple tasks going beyond basic tasks programmed Professor Andrei Barbu MIT Center Brains Minds Machines told adding effective AI research creating systems fine tuned solve specific problem He says although forays unsupervised learning systems work data hasn labeled way work still infancy One better known examples fed random YouTube thumbnails 10 million videos Eventually taught cat looked like creators make wider claims ability As LeCun said event Orange Institute last year We know unsupervised learning That biggest obstacle Artificial intelligence field study also tendency fall victim hype It often happens new method found progress made quickly commentators often computer scientists make bold claims rate improvement continue ve created robot butlers Just take example describes early form AI
