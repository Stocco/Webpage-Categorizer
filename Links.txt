lot better big screens Virtually everything smartphones enhanced larger display messaging playing games watching video reading articles browsing web name After stripped core modern smartphone little touchscreen display front ultra compact connected supercomputer honest big phones pain neck They clumsy hold easy drop fit comfortably pockets look ridiculous arm exercising impossible use one hand But could phone big screen able comfortably use one hand What easily slipped pocket yet still provided immersive display great watch video play games And still big enough battery power big display day long regardless much used phone Samsung betting answer questions new Galaxy S7 smartphone The Galaxy S7 actually two phones standard S7 650 695 depending carrier S7 Edge 750 795 depending carrier It Edge truly tries solve big phone problem using Samsung unique curved display technology The S7 models aren hugely different last year Galaxy S6 pair fact look almost identical The Galaxy S6s watershed moment Android devices first ones could stand next iPhone terms design materials performance camera quality So S7 Samsung didn rewrite formula Instead took good S6 refined iterated upon produced something much better standard S7 less interesting model It similar last year phone size display 5 1 inch quad HD Super AMOLED materials metal glass plastic found overall shape design It little bit heavier little bit thicker S6 egregiously either category The S7 adopted Note 5 curved glass back makes comfortable hold despite thicker profile The home button doesn stick much rear camera housing doesn protrude much likely phone millimeter thicker S6 It refined version S6 overall largely hardware experience The S7 Edge hand undergone dramatic changes While last year S6 Edge 5 1 inch display standard model S7 Edge steps phablet class 5 5 inch screen also quad HD Super AMOLED fantastic look That make taller wider nearly much might expect The secret S7 Edge curved sides give Edge name Samsung curving screens phones years including S6 Edge larger S6 Edge But felt like gimmick marketing purposes anything else The curved sides S7 Edge different Samsung using make phone much narrower would flat display It makes whole device smaller easier use That becomes readily apparent put S7 Edge next devices 5 5 inch similar screens It significantly narrower including Apple iPhone 6S Plus 5 5 inch LG G4 5 5 inch Google Nexus 6P 5 7 inch Samsung Note 5 5 7 inch When comes ease use hand narrower phone much easier manage The S7 Edge also curved glass back making much comfortable hold easier pick desk table last year S6 Edge The whole thing rounded polished delightful flip hand much like river stone tumbled water millennia two It slips pants pocket ease short enough stay pocket I sit That something I say iPhone 6S Plus Nexus 6P Note 5 On top Samsung managed make S7 models water resistant They withstand 30 minutes meter half water important thing worry fallible human around phone The tiny tragedies day day life become big deal spilling coffee phone desk keeping sink re dishes calling Uber rainstorm worse dropping toilet re sheets wind The S7s fiddly flaps port covers accomplish either Samsung isn first phone company make water resistant phone S7s Samsung first water resistant models something phones especially high end ones spec lists beautiful look joy pick That aided new colors Samsung using year silver gold little boring black gorgeous refined deep inky right amount reflectivity It seems silly excited black phone since many various shades grey actually black anymore refreshing change pace Also really good black My real complaint glass phones like rare earth magnet fingerprints It also makes slippery especially cold weather skin dry hardware re going make truly competitive exceptional device Samsung upgraded everything inside S7s The new processor Qualcomm US I tested markets Samsung Exynos chip paired 4GB RAM trouble multitasking gaming playing video task I attempted It fast responsive phone ready anything I needed And encrypted default something slowed phones past The performance quibble I speed fingerprint scanner home button It reliable fast enough annoying lightning quick scanners iPhone 6S Nexus 5X 6P The battery life improvements S7 models noticeable appreciated The S6 fatal flaw non removable battery provided inconsistent results people included couldn last entire day To address Samsung used brute force method jamming much larger batteries S7 models The standard S7 3 000mAh cell 17 6 percent larger S7 Edge whopping 3 600mAh 38 5 percent larger battery This helps explain year phones millimeter thicker last year reversal trend make phones ever thinner predecessors Without question Samsung made right decision I d gladly take slightly thicker phone extended battery life provide Advanced users notice Samsung supporting Android Marshmallow combined storage feature makes SD card internal storage one giant partition Samsung implementation designed store photos video music files makes possible easily transfer files SD card isn possible combined storage secure encryption modern smartphone new one Galaxy S7 home run Samsung built upon last year already excellent camera made faster time takes launch time takes autofocus This produces one impressive smartphone cameras I ve ever used physically larger pixels brighter lens loss resolution made better low light performance It still optical image stabilization record 4K video The S7 camera produces bright sharp detailed images I didn hesitate rely S7 camera I needed The new 12 megapixel camera sensor different shape 16 megapixel sensor S6 4 3 opposed 16 9 A 4 3 aspect ratio appropriate still images especially portrait orientation set S6 4 3 camera settings d end 12 megapixel image The real world resolution differences two cameras far less might inferred megapixel counts Part new dual pixel autofocus technology Samsung says kind technology found DSLR cameras Each pixel S7 sensor acts autofocus point camera able quickly focus subject adjust moves The effect noticeable shooting video camera rack focus two points The camera performs well bright situations low light though still tends produce overly warm yellow images light levels drop And though noticeable time bit much sharpening applied images becomes apparent zoom fact Samsung camera app one best available Android simple automatic modes advanced manual controls S7 also capture RAW images want The S7 also tends overexpose images I often found using camera exposure compensation tool adjust A new feature camera app called Motion photo yes similar Apple Live Photos Samsung version captures short video clip seconds image captured doesn record anything fact doesn record audio It also possible share download video clips computer makes fairly useless Samsung says idea behind Motion photos capture moments may missed shutter snapped It possible grab still frames Motion photo video share Overall S7 camera isn huge leap forward S6 camera largely S6 camera already good The noticeable improvement speed launching using brilliant double press home button feature speed autofocus In side side tests S7 camera produced brighter sharper images iPhone 6S Plus faster autofocus especially poor lighting figure make great hardware past couple years struggled software S7 software easily weakest point The phones run Android 6 0 Marshmallow Samsung customized TouchWiz interface top TouchWiz improved gets slightly better looking year I still find less attractive cartoony compared Google take Android Fortunately easily theme look Nexus like want Samsung says worked Google reduce number redundant apps adds Google suite Verizon S7 I tested comes one browser Chrome box carrier models Chrome Samsung browser But still two email apps two photos apps three music players two voice control systems two app stores two text messaging apps On top Verizon adds It likely carrier models similar AT T even advertises S7 comes loaded DirecTV apps probably want It d really great Samsung stood carriers stopped loading otherwise great phones bunch useless apps company still lot work left One solution would sell unlocked version directly without carrier branding Samsung yet commit The carrier models compatible carriers Verizon model get LTE service AT T example complicates matters There two new software features year improvement Edge screen feature introduced last year Available S7 Edge Edge screen lets swipe side quickly access contacts shortcuts apps weather sport scores news including ruler compass The panel twice wide allowing display content But I still found mostly gimmick turned days The thing Samsung needs work detecting errant touches sides S7 Edge far often inside palm would touch sides display I holding confuse phone Both phones new always display mode show time date battery life image calendar times without wake phone The always display also shows icons missed calls messages provided use Samsung native apps doesn show notifications It also interactive double tap screen wake fully act notification badges directly always mode It convenient able see time date without touch phone overall I find useful similar features Motorola Google phones The Game Launcher seems believe full screen app game It seems like reasonable assumption non game apps trigger tiny little shortcut dot I particularly think needed Slack example You turn shortcut dot entirely refinement needed company popularized phablet one pushing forward working make best large screened smartphone get Big screened phones awesome even awesome easily put pocket handle one hand without finger gymnastics The S7 S7 Edge aren perfect software still lags behind hardware get basics right great screens great cameras great performance reliable battery life They also eye catching designs premium materials Android world level polish unmatched The S7 Edge clear standout two models

Aerospace engineers dreamed spaceship launch like plane get orbit land runway since 1960s A British company Reaction Engines Limited wants make dream reality REL sleek winged spaceplane called Skylon looks like something retro futuristic visions old magazine covers The uncrewed spacecraft built fly like jet gets altitude 92 000 feet five times speed sound 3 800 miles per hour Then rocket propulsion shoot Skylon orbit along 15 metric tons cargo On return designed glide waiting airport rather like Space Shuttle According recent economic analysis REL backstopping independent consultancy London Economics Skylon get pound mass orbit 686 1 230 per pound depending optimistic forecast This comparable SpaceX currently advertised rate 2 100 per pound Falcon 9 770 upcoming Falcon Heavy according NASA One reason NASA estimate high relative SpaceX Skylon Shuttle expensive NASA reveal total costs SpaceX private company estimating actual costs opposed price difficult Yet still big hurdles Nobody made combined jet rocket design work let alone single stage orbit Designing propulsion system one biggest obstacles pure rockets jet engines one thing combining another And building something flies conditions give advanced designs run money Compared spaceplane building Concorde easy The secret getting spaceplane aloft Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine SABRE combination jet engine rocket Initially breathes air functioning way jet engine igniting hydrogen fuel oxygen atmosphere Once air gets thin simply switches using onboard tank oxygen Ordinarily jet engine operate speeds Skylon flies The fastest jet plane ever flown SR 71 Blackbird hits three times speed sound Go much faster air coming engine compresses heats engine cooks The solution Cool air coming When air comes SABRE gets cooled liquid helium The helium cooled via exchanger uses liquid hydrogen fuel Once helium done pre cooling air gets heated combustion hydrogen oxygen energy drives turbines engine The combined mechanism saves weight allows engine work resting start While engines important part craft challenges still give experts pause Heat one The Space Shuttle covered tiles metals wouldn handle heat generated re entry We called crockery covered spacecraft said Ivan Bekey former head Advanced Concepts Office NASA private design consultant If re flying 25 times speed sound spaceplane heat becomes problem ascent well REL says plans two layers skin Skylon separated small space The outer layer made ceramics materials development decades advanced since Shuttles built says Richard Varvill technical director REL That help insulate craft zooms upper atmosphere For re entry Skylon won come way Shuttle Varvill says instead plunging atmosphere Skylon take gentler approach It efficient aerodynamic shape says sharper leading edges wing The overall heating lot less Shuttle though local hot spots Skylon need local cooling systems The heating shouldn get hundred degrees

presentation kind language tend associate players abstract board games Or computers matter Lee Se dol says surprised receive AlphaGo challenge hadn expected AI reach level top players another decade There beauty game Go I think machines understand beauty says But instantly curious took less five minutes accept invitation On stage today Lee Se dol expressed confidence d beat AlphaGo I believe human intuition advanced AI caught yet said noted since learning AlphaGo capabilities gotten slightly nervous longer convinced ll win series 5 0 I make mistakes often said I make single mistake human I might lose Even 4 1 victory Lee Se dol would represent major achievement DeepMind British company acquired Google reported 400 million 2014 The unit ultimate mission less solve intelligence potential uses ranging healthcare robotics attaining long sought computer science dream world beating Go program would catapult DeepMind forefront AI research Go probably elegant game humanity invented says DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis former child prodigy chess There possible Go positions atoms universe Hassabis notes chess average around 20 possible moves given position Go gives player ten times many options resulting massively higher branching factor far harder AI deal Appropriately enough given DeepMind parent company solution requires efficient search algorithm But isn much use Go without improved ability evaluate game biggest challenge computers much harder work winning game like chess example AlphaGo powered two guide machine learning search techniques arriving best move narrowing shortening tree diagram possibilities And program initially learned play Go fed data historical real world matches since trained playing thousands matches continually reinforcing ability I think impressive says Murray Campbell IBM research scientist one principal creators Deep Blue They ve clearly advanced state art That AlphaGo able shock Go community beating Fan Hui last October first

wrong On one hand I believe Lee Se dol advantage experience says University Alberta Jonathan Schaeffer computer scientist wrote Chinook first software program solve checkers Lee knows lot Go AlphaGo learning less year It possible gaps AlphaGo yet apparent enough time learn well play scenarios might arise game On hand never underestimate technology I actually clue I m excited see game AlphaGo plays level opponent says Lee Ha jin When plays Lee Se dol means play Lee Se dol level I ve never seen imagined computer playing level Maybe Eric Schmidt struck right note said result victory humanity

possible think layers Neural networks bottom re type computer architecture onto artificial intelligence built Machine learning next program might run neural network training computers look certain answers pots data deep learning top particular type machine learning become popular past decade largely thanks two new resources cheap processing power abundant data otherwise known internet The concept neural networks goes way back 50s beginning AI field research In nutshell networks way structuring computer looks like cartoon brain comprised neuron like nodes connected together web Individually nodes dumb answering extremely basic questions collectively tackle difficult problems More importantly right algorithms taught With conventional programming would give precise set rules telling look left right wait cars use pedestrian crossings etc let go With machine learning d instead show 10 000 videos someone crossing road safely 10 000 videos someone getting hit car let thing Over past couple decades people tried sorts different methods try teach computers These methods include example reinforcement learning give computer reward thing want gradually optimizing best solution genetic algorithms competing methods solving problem pitted one another manner comparable natural selection In today classrooms computers one teaching method become particularly useful deep learning type machine learning uses lots layers neural network analyze data different abstractions So deep learning system looking picture layer essentially tackling different magnification The bottom layer might look 5 x 5 grids pixels answering simply yes whether something shows grid If answers yes layer looks see grid fits larger pattern Is beginning line example corner This process gradually builds allowing software understand even complicated data breaking constituent parts Next let imagine want teach computer cat looks like using deep learning First d take neural network program different layers identify different elements cat claws paws whiskers etc Each layer would built layers allow recognize particular element called deep learning Then network shown lot images cats animals told This cat tell computer showing picture cat This also cat This As neural network sees different images different layers nodes within light recognize claws paws whiskers etc Over time remembers layers important aren strengthening connections disregarding others It might discover paws example strongly correlated cats also appear things cats learns look paws also appear alongside whiskers This long iterative process system slowly getting better based feedback Either human correct computer nudging right direction Or network large enough pot labeled data test seeing different weightings layers produce accurate answers Now imagine many steps needed say whether something cat think complex systems recognize well everything else exists world That Microsoft proud However deep learning proved adept tasks involving speech image recognition stuff lots commercial applications also plenty limitations Not deep learning techniques require lot data fine tuning work intelligence narrow brittle As cognitive psychologist Gary Marcus acquiring abstract ideas like sibling identical They obvious ways performing logical inferences also still long way integrating abstract knowledge information objects typically used In words common sense neural network used generate picture dumbbell trained sample images The pictures dumbbells produced pretty good two gray circles connected horizontal tube But middle weight muscular outline bodybuilder arm This pictures network trained often shown bodybuilder holding dumbbell Deep learning might able work common visual properties tens thousands pictures dumbbells would never make cognitive leap say dumbbells arms These sorts problems aren limited common sense either Because way examine data deep learning networks also These sorts limitations artfully hidden though Take new wave digital assistants like Siri example often seem like understand us answering questions setting alarms telling preprogrammed jokes quips along way But computer scientist Hector Levesque points quirks show big gap AI real intelligence Levesque uses points machines best challenge rely tricks make people think re talking human They use jokes quotations emotional outbursts misdirection manner verbal dodges confuse distract questioners And indeed machine said publications A better test AI domain says Levesque would quiz machines surreal logical questions demand sort wide causal knowledge Marcus describes Levesque offers example questions like Could crocodile run steeplechase Should baseball players allowed glue small wings onto caps Imagine sort things computer would know even attempt answer soon machines conquered task previously humans could whether playing chess recognizing faces longer considered mark intelligence As computer scientists Larry Tesler put Intelligence whatever machines haven done yet And even tasks computers beat aren replicating human intelligence When say neural network like brain true says LeCun It true

Of virtual reality headsets HTC Vive feels like science fiction visionaries promised us 80s 90s Yes every single product evokes set comparisons jacking Matrix hanging Holodeck These always wrong generation VR forgetting world inhabit virtual real But Vive room scale virtual reality setup focused letting wearers interact world naturally possible comparison seems less hyperbolic usual Created phone manufacturer HTC gaming company Valve Vive impressed us small doses since announced 2015 But late last week Valve sent us Vive Pre development kit similar final hardware shipping next month It first chance I ve spend real sustained time top notch VR system Last time I able use consumer headset wild Samsung Gear VR worrying technology couldn offer enough justify awkwardness It soon make call Vive something buy makes better case VR entertainment device new computing interface anything I ve ever tried The first difference Vive headsets appears start setting While tracking VR usually involves placing camera front around Vive includes two tiny black boxes mount corners room used light stands also screw wall put top bookcase They standard \xc2\xbc inch 20 TPI tripod screw mount bottom The boxes project lasers area 15 15 feet letting sensors headset controllers calibrate location If ve got enough space least gets deck part Holodeck partially right re pressing buttons taking tentative little steps re actually pacing around room It excellent shutting reality You lean peek nosepiece little highly effective blindfold This isn without costs All high end VR headsets look bulky Vive league bulbous pockmarked face mask braid wires running straight top head straps inches short forming full wetsuit hood The Pre actually fewer cords original development kit featured wired controllers connector two lighthouse boxes But remaining ones become long cable dragging behind plugging small box turn connects powerful PC The wireless controllers look like TV remotes topped large rings sensors also little heavy They feel well balanced Oculus Touch controllers won come later year But track almost perfectly last long enough Micro USB charges indicator weirdly seen controllers VR still shows half power six hours Most interactions involve solidly clicky trigger underside small round trackpad top side bumpers activate squeezing A dedicated home button sits beneath trackpad pulling flat version Steam interface blue laser pointer ll use make selections It clear simple interface except one thing home button The headset suffers problems long plagued VR The close fitting foam mask gets soaked sweat overexert becomes putting re passing around group The lenses fog nearly badly early headsets re easy accidentally smear The screen quality excellent VR standards still pick pixels try These last two flaws issues everybody HTC Valve re distinct drawback first generation virtual reality general especially re talking product costs hundreds dollars 99 Gear VR Still Vive remarkably comfortable I m incapable playing mobile VR games plenty early Rift games half hour without nausea I ve felt twinge motion sickness hours Vive triggered mini golfing game I teleported around quickly Early I got mild intermittent headaches taking short break loosening headset quelled The motion tracking close perfect disorientation sick making mismatch re seeing body The weirdest part using Vive really realizing requires totally new kind computing setup potentially good enough make change feel almost natural With relatively simple headset like Gear VR virtual reality awkward finicky offshoot normal phone laptop use I ll pull headset remember I play VR games couch sigh either move spinning chair desk forget whole endeavor In theory Vive even alienating It supports seated experiences games I ve seen use mix standing place moving couple steps side strolling around larger space You quickly learn step clear cord normal walking still gets tangled re turning frequently Similarly realize small room much space furniture takes re measuring perimeter Vive space The Vive chaperone system brings faint grid whenever get within foot two edge usually stop outright running wall The Vive front facing camera isn yet active also show detailed outline real world reach outside VR space But Vive Pre won account chair forgot push friend wandered see re might unintentionally block laser tracking system I ve far avoided accidentally pistol whipping anybody Vive anyone used Wii Remote know swinging controller around comes kinds risks reason Vive hardware incorporates wrist straps But overall experience different doesn invite comparisons anything else Oculus Sony shown several games play like ordinary console platformers shooters role playing games even virtual reality gives new feel Valve HTC ban traditional gamepads chairs barely acknowledge existence treating included motion controllers default way use VR With exception totally passive vignettes everything Valve showcasing Vive Pre uses motion form whether re painting shooting fencing drawing airplane flight paths mid air With best think wonder re walking around waving arms d wonder mouse smartphone Tilt Brush arguably strongest experience Vive perfect example It painting program treats three dimensional space canvas resulting pieces fuse sculpture illustration Tilt Brush could use slightly complex options even limited artistic vision I found wishing things like layers scaling rotation But got enough depth I could imagine seeing something like Oculus Quill tool professional setting something done well motion tracking augmented virtual reality The interesting part interface changes way use electronics Moving hands paint let alone swinging around virtual sword lot tiring using mouse keyboard The cadence playing video game becomes like playing sports hours eventually re going wear hit wall And tools like Tilt Brush VR becomes standing desk doesn feel like exercise righteous self denial The obvious criticism already tried rejected motion interface Kinect I won rule comparison Vive least assured VR controllers far far precise reliable Kinect ever And conceptual level VR better job linking physical action visual results If somebody made Vive version adorable As Kinect Vive success depend people Valve offers handful demos Vive Pre Its larger software experience remains rough features like ability pair phone get calls VR exist yet There way make final call Vive quality whether worth 800 But probably safe predict next month ll able buy first complete virtual reality system

Esci In questo tempo attraversato da guerre e conflitti di diversa natura il Mediterraneo torna essere un crocevia fondamentale da cui pu\xc3\xb2 e deve passare l alternativa della pace e del dialogo In realt\xc3\xa0 questo mare lo \xc3\xa8 sempre stato da millenni per la sua posizione geografica e per le civilt\xc3\xa0 che si sono sviluppate attorno alle sue sponde Per divertirsi per concludere degnamente una serata di droga e alcool forse \xc3\xa8 meglio buttare dal treno uno sconosciuto O dare fuoco un barbone Si \xc3\xa8 gi\xc3\xa0 visto anche questo E allora un Andr\xc3\xa8 Gide contemporaneo che romanzo deve scrivere per segnalare o contenere o condannare questa deriva da assenza di empatia questa regressione alla disumanit\xc3\xa0 Che Ankara non rispetti gli standard europei materia di diritti umani di libert\xc3\xa0 di stampa e di democrazia generale anzi che stia addirittura peggiorando velocemente sotto questi aspetti non ci interessa pi\xc3\xb9 Basta che chiuda le sue frontiere e che ci tolga di mezzo profughi che consegneremo nelle loro mani senza avere nessuna garanzia sul trattamento di cui godranno Siamo passati dalla straordinariet\xc3\xa0 di trasmissioni come Un giorno Pretura alla ordinariet\xc3\xa0 di troupe televisive che stazionano perennemente davanti alle case di imputati e vittime Il Servizio Pubblico \xc3\xa8 chiamato insieme alle altre centrali educative di questo Paese dare un segnale di inversione di tendenza soprattutto prestando attenzione alle nuove generazioni Vanno create le condizioni per una pi\xc3\xb9 attenta e matura consapevolezza rispetto ad episodi di cronaca di simile violenza L 8 marzo \xc3\xa8 passato ormai ma qualcosa ancora qui non va avrebbe detto il mitico Lucio Dalla Perch\xc3\xa9 Banalmente perch\xc3\xa9 non serve pi\xc3\xb9 Cos\xc3\xac come \xc3\xa8 affogato un mare di melassa e mimose l 8 marzo \xc3\xa8 diventato inutile e anti storico E allora per dirla con il Premier cambiamo verso 8 marzo rottamiamo una festa che sembra ridotta un luogo comune Dietro l iniziativa pare di leggere anche un certo sessismo oggi siete libere andate e acculturatevi O anche la considerazione retriva che le donne siano un gruppo minoritario da proteggere e valorizzare ah le donne Una giornata gratis al museo \xc3\xa8 come se il governo degli Stati Uniti epoca avesse offerto ai neri una giornata senza biglietto per l autobus Oggi mi sono venute mente tutte le donne coraggiose forti straordinarie giovani e anziane che ho incontrato questi anni provenienti da Siria Eritrea Nigeria Somalia Mamme ragazze bambine che hanno lasciato un contesto difficilissimo ma conosciuto per l incerto che hanno affrontato paure ostacoli e violenze per assicurare un futuro ai propri figli o per rivendicare per s\xc3\xa9 una vita migliore Preso atto dei propri limiti partiti dovrebbero limitarsi predisporre una piattaforma e garantire un minimo di regolarit\xc3\xa0 confidando un voto d opinione che superi difetti atavici degli apparati ormai incancreniti da almeno tre decenni di declino e mancanza di investimenti Qui scarsa affluenza e brogli si palesano come due facce della stessa medaglia \xc3\x88 la seconda volta 5 anni che un ombra oscura il voto dei tanti elettori stavolta oltre 30 000 che si sono recati alle urne per le primarie Se \xc3\xa8 vero che le primarie sono un dato genetico del Pd trattarle cos\xc3\xac significa minare alle fondamenta l esistenza stessa del partito A Napoli per 5 anni \xc3\xa8 proprio quel che \xc3\xa8 accaduto Anche se ha gi\xc3\xa0 annunciato le sue scelte musicali il Presidente Rebelo de Sousa deve ancora presentare piani per cinque anni del suo mandato ma \xc3\xa8 probabile che cercher\xc3\xa0 una collaborazione con il blocco di sinistra al governo come fece Parlamento quando era segretario generale del partito moderato PSD dal 1996 al 1999 La povert\xc3\xa0 \xc3\xa8 sessista Lo dice ONE e lo sottoscrivono tantissimi gli attori Colin Farrell e Meryl Streep la star televisiva Oprah Winfrey nel mondo Onu la direttrice del Wfp Ertharin Cousin quello del giornalismo Arianna Huffington Gi\xc3\xa0 7 milioni di persone nel corso del tempo hanno aderito alle sue iniziative Obiettivo sensibilizzare l opinione pubblica e far pressione sui governi Il metodo Renzi scelgo non mi schiero e non escludo vedi il caso di Bassolino Napoli \xc3\xa8 alla fine un metodo vincente il premier si \xc3\xa8 comportato cos\xc3\xac per le elezioni Puglia Emilia Romagna Campania e via elencando La sola bussola \xc3\xa8 vincere Vecchio nuovo passato presente maggioranza e minoranza Renzi non interessa Ci sono due libert\xc3\xa0 che configgono quella delle donne che vogliono ricorrere interruzione di gravidanza quella del personale obiettore che pu\xc3\xb2 rifiutarsi di garantire l esercizio di questo diritto delle donne \xc3\x88 un conflitto che va sanato perch\xc3\xa9 uno stato laico come si professa essere il nostro deve poter vincere la libert\xc3\xa0 garantita dalla legge L impiego diffuso di manodopera femminile precaria aumenta il rischio di violazioni dei diritti umani fondamentali di discriminazioni e di molestie sessuali Spesso questo tipo di aziende le donne causa della loro condizione di estrema povert\xc3\xa0 sono costrette lavorare per moltissime ore al giorno per sfamare le proprie famiglie Dopo l ondata di annunci e sollecitazioni line con email e sms che Roma e Napoli si era sollevata con le primarie ritorna il gelido silenzio fra elettori ed eletti \xc3\x88 davvero singolare quest uso frenetico delle rete da parte dei candidati politici Si arroventa nei pressi del voto si iberna subito dopo La notte il trafficante chiamava il nome di una donna che gli piaceva per farla uscire dalla tenda dove dormivano tutte insieme e andare da lui Se lei si rifiutava lui la forzava dicendo voglio aiutarti voglio darti soldi Ti lascer\xc3\xb2 viaggiare Europa senza pagare niente A loro donne rifugiate il Parlamento europeo ha deciso di dedicare la Giornata internazionale delle donne di quest anno Quando parliamo di femminicidio non pensiamo solo ai fatti di cronaca Dietro esiste una realt\xc3\xa0 molto complessa e articolata fatta di donne che soffrono e che muoiono ogni giorno Colpite nel corpo e nell anima Che esse si uccidano o vengano uccise \xc3\xa8 sempre la mano del carnefice che cala su di loro E certe volte questa \xc3\xa8 aiutata come nel caso delle anziane che praticano l infibulazione anche dalle donne Il suo sogno era partecipare alle Olimpiadi di Atlanta e la prima volta cui si trov\xc3\xb2 davanti un sacco decise che ce l avrebbe fatta Le dissero che era impossibile che le donne non tirano di boxe e che se lo fanno al massimo lo fanno palestra non su un ring Las Vegas o zona Olimpia Nel deserto del qualunquismo devastante del disimpegno nel tanto tutto \xc3\xa8 uno schifo dell essere semplicemente persone per bene che vacilla ho qui davanti una mamma di tre ragazzi separata che si \xc3\xa8 rifiutata di piegarsi alla Mafia e ad alcune delle sue famiglie pi\xc3\xb9 potenti Una che \xc3\xa8 andata dai Carabinieri e ha denunciato ha cambiato vita con suoi figli nel giro di tre ore scappando da Palermo Non vi preoccupate magari oggi vostri figli non lo capiscono ancora notano solo la vostra assenza le scorpacciate di dolci ma tenete duro continuate costruire
