Tech companies partly encouraged elision artificial intelligence sci fi AI especially anthropomorphic digital assistants useful comes understanding computers new exciting With mind primer aims explain commonly used terms consumer applications artificial intelligence well looking limitations current technology shouldn worrying robot uprising yet These three terms re likely heard lately simple possible think layers Neural networks bottom re type computer architecture onto artificial intelligence built Machine learning next program might run neural network training computers look certain answers pots data deep learning top particular type machine learning become popular past decade largely thanks two new resources cheap processing power abundant data otherwise known internet The concept neural networks goes way back 50s beginning AI field research In nutshell networks way structuring computer looks like cartoon brain comprised neuron like nodes connected together web Individually nodes dumb answering extremely basic questions collectively tackle difficult problems More importantly right algorithms taught With conventional programming would give precise set rules telling look left right wait cars use pedestrian crossings etc let go With machine learning d instead show 10 000 videos someone crossing road safely 10 000 videos someone getting hit car let thing Over past couple decades people tried sorts different methods try teach computers These methods include example reinforcement learning give computer reward thing want gradually optimizing best solution genetic algorithms competing methods solving problem pitted one another manner comparable natural selection In today classrooms computers one teaching method become particularly useful deep learning type machine learning uses lots layers neural network analyze data different abstractions So deep learning system looking picture layer essentially tackling different magnification The bottom layer might look 5 x 5 grids pixels answering simply yes whether something shows grid If answers yes layer looks see grid fits larger pattern Is beginning line example corner This process gradually builds allowing software understand even complicated data breaking constituent parts Next let imagine want teach computer cat looks like using deep learning First d take neural network program different layers identify different elements cat claws paws whiskers etc Each layer would built layers allow recognize particular element called deep learning Then network shown lot images cats animals told This cat tell computer showing picture cat This also cat This As neural network sees different images different layers nodes within light recognize claws paws whiskers etc Over time remembers layers important aren strengthening connections disregarding others It might discover paws example strongly correlated cats also appear things cats learns look paws also appear alongside whiskers This long iterative process system slowly getting better based feedback Either human correct computer nudging right direction Or network large enough pot labeled data test seeing different weightings layers produce accurate answers Now imagine many steps needed say whether something cat think complex systems recognize well everything else exists world That Microsoft proud However deep learning proved adept tasks involving speech image recognition stuff lots commercial applications also plenty limitations Not deep learning techniques require lot data fine tuning work intelligence narrow brittle As cognitive psychologist Gary Marcus acquiring abstract ideas like sibling identical They obvious ways performing logical inferences also still long way integrating abstract knowledge information objects typically used In words common sense neural network used generate picture dumbbell trained sample images The pictures dumbbells produced pretty good two gray circles connected horizontal tube But middle weight muscular outline bodybuilder arm This pictures network trained often shown bodybuilder holding dumbbell Deep learning might able work common visual properties tens thousands pictures dumbbells would never make cognitive leap say dumbbells arms These sorts problems aren limited common sense either Because way examine data deep learning networks also These sorts limitations artfully hidden though Take new wave digital assistants like Siri example often seem like understand us answering questions setting alarms telling preprogrammed jokes quips along way But computer scientist Hector Levesque points quirks show big gap AI real intelligence Levesque uses points machines best challenge rely tricks make people think re talking human They use jokes quotations emotional outbursts misdirection manner verbal dodges confuse distract questioners And indeed machine said publications A better test AI domain says Levesque would quiz machines surreal logical questions demand sort wide causal knowledge Marcus describes Levesque offers example questions like Could crocodile run steeplechase Should baseball players allowed glue small wings onto caps Imagine sort things computer would know even attempt answer soon machines conquered task previously humans could whether playing chess recognizing faces longer considered mark intelligence As computer scientists Larry Tesler put Intelligence whatever machines haven done yet And even tasks computers beat aren replicating human intelligence When say neural network like brain true says LeCun It true way airplanes aren like birds They flap wings feathers muscles If create intelligence says won like human intelligence animal intelligence It difficult us imagine example intelligent entity impulse towards self preservation Many people working within field AI dismissive idea ll ever able create artificial intelligence truly sentient There approach moment hope flexible performing multiple tasks going beyond basic tasks programmed Professor Andrei Barbu MIT Center Brains Minds Machines told adding effective AI research creating systems fine tuned solve specific problem He says although forays unsupervised learning systems work data hasn labeled way work still infancy One better known examples fed random YouTube thumbnails 10 million videos Eventually taught cat looked like creators make wider claims ability As LeCun said event Orange Institute last year We know unsupervised learning That biggest obstacle Artificial intelligence field study also tendency fall victim hype It often happens new method found progress made quickly commentators often computer scientists make bold claims rate improvement continue ve created robot butlers Just take example describes early form AI machine tell difference left right electronic embryo one day able walk talk see write reproduce conscious existence When sorts promises aren fulfilled field tends fall known AI winter period pessimism reduced funding There half dozen minor AI winters two major ones late 70s early 90s And true every field scientific research goes fallow periods worth noting disciplines disappoint acolytes reliably come special name Imagine future flawless self driving car comes equipped advanced digital assistant one Siri descendants perhaps This might sort cheating chatbot Levesque isn impressed one trick

The iPhone SE Surely Expensive phone What ever happened 399 phone I cannot believe 4 phone selling higher price 400 ya know may pull little fairy dust still charming masses The advantage I see security perhaps resale value though pay plenty upfront Only pure Android gets update thus negative I prefer Android lived year iOS phone works like Android I guess selling point security less bugs true seems stable Uneasy feeling agitated I meant Perhaps every dang cut ever made commercial stuff I hear predictable repeating monotonous sounds many stuff I heard one many time The profanity repeated Doesn mean simple boring agitated Nothing wrong poetry spoken sung word set music background good And yes good subjective load commercial stuff bad subjective Same new pop stuff new country lot new stuff lazy art I may never like bulk doubt And yes doesn matter one bit I like But doesn mean I may find something searching around catch ear I try Pimping A Butterfly one two new Kayne non commercial stuff Some interesting stuff Grammy winning To Pimp Butterfly I pick Some lyrics thought ol stuff sells You right I know rap As history America let say I know bit I seen decline America jobs outsourced country run corporate 1 world When Reagan declared end industrial nation heading towards services tech I knew many cities would hurting cities people within races people As discrimination neighbors years ago black man wife told able buy home new area little city He inner city LA moved smaller town getting job railroad So discrimination less spoken small town well He well buying one two homes nearby Thing may well different stayed inner city It great let racist within town keep far far good people little town city Anyway I enjoy music I like And I like little every type music though country music much unless done greats Mostly quality pop rock jazz Spanish punk cross overs pop yea I know pure classical hard rock stuff I fairly young Beatle era hit So yea 60s rock I go little raggae music Sorry I sounded rap stuff I may look around non commercial grade stuff Pretty sure sell like new Pop ain good As Pimp Butterfly listen go back maybe reading lyrics first song Older ears harder keep goodness brain slowing Some interesting arrangements use backing vocals video effects songs Some like rollercoaster moods So wish stay keep Keep repeating I I cannot get ahead many times possible reinforce world without possibilities How help others gutter Are rapper millions dollars gutters homeless I think What positive measures towards helping people making better life young need join gangs live fear 3 UK interesting Thanks info I looked In Calif Jimi Hendrix really popular I thought charts would placed higher If I recall All Along Watchtower big If going back time Carol King album took prize Grammy Tapestry Album good one Now compare 1989 Taylor Swift I best stop I getting people mad doubt And Hip Hop Rap anything else polka music make happy go Yes songs make sad emotion kind fine well Some songs deep thought Paul Simon wrote load great stuff especially early depth wise But I cannot listen whole albums full stuff downer Now country music gets spin backwards happy life returns truck girlfriend dog well ya know comes back full mug beer Pop sells girl pop sells always perhaps always If Hip Hop gets popular appears running pretty solid days filling concerts may pass pop stars music It nothing race Michele Jackson pop years There long long list black artists top And yet I never said anything black people expressing accomplishment struggles fears dreams This interesting comment sections stuff gets made Few lyrics I seen come close expressing much dreams hope love enjoying life I sure Hip Hop lyrics good great Still see profanity calling women ho bitch good thing even classy Now far words used depth content I admit speaking popular radio class correct saying people heard less known rap So yes true judge rap hip hop say West rest know hear Do find West lyrics deep It It majority sales Otherwise would group people critique art works one heard Could good thing people would hear new artist world I doubt anyone would attend listen program Well Elvis sold moves matured great voice It voice Yes I recall Ed Sullivan Show showing upper part Elvis show dancing That truly silly vulgar Personally I like writer singers like Paul Simon Paul McCartney Elvis great voice however And girls loved Grammy majority sales I would think An example The Beach Boys Pet Sounds well done went nowhere sales Grammy Awards far I know think ever got Grammy year They popular popular sold even records The audience Grammy plays popular music field greatest attention popularity Pop Rock It ignoring rest This Rap thing recognized popular sells audience less numbers seems But yea majority going get top bill If majority liked polka music would hearing I usually ignore Grammy little music days I wish I seen Uptown Funk catch video fun stuff great singing What mean Do follow lyrics spoken look later Why always mention names within rap Why contain exact words explicit banned words list Some interesting complexity production work went Lamar work speak As Taylor Swift I see song dance act cute good entertainer really album builder I follow music days mostly terrible bad one many year tend tune Bruno Mars video Uptown Funk I thought really cool glad made grade The Rap stuff sounds like noise anger makes rather uneasy I stuck elevator listening Barry Manalow music ya escape feeling But I like perhaps Lamar album would place start thought went much engineering producing time effort words If liking Rap Hip Hop perhaps good Almost forgot passive aggressive inclusive diversity words rule day Recall 1970 I think everything communication problem Oh well I left message use tech section That inclusive tech excluding Kayne In order provide users better overall experience ask information Facebook using login learn audience provide best possible

encrypted protected Touch ID strong passcode I think I could live The risk would still exceedingly low Perhaps I m crazily lazy I mean come raising wrist payment terminal much trouble But general attitude technology half job eliminating need effort even effort saved minimal I guy I think d terrible idea doomed fail even Apple Hands Free Pay It falls first hurdle It requires retailers add special equipment existing POS systems They won At least Apple pay uses existing industry standard technology majority stores already planning install anyway I believe story bit different US UK least stores already contactless technology read normal cards One beautiful things Apple Pay I even need tell retailer I m paying phone I m paying Apple Pay I ve sadly found staff get confused I simply say I m paying card already know Utilising existing contactless system perfect To read phone different Google ultimately surrender fact either unified Google Android brand rather separate ones already haven already bother Or even heaven forbid I m sure license Apple Pay That last bit mostly joke I see happening The technology great could problems behind What bugs ruin experience facial recognition doesn recognize face Yes I know fix might take time see real potential Modern day facial recognition tech good The latest techniques use three cameras build 3D image face allowing literally hundreds measurements made including things detailed contours eye sockets exact shape nose This supplemented skin texture analysis lines patterns skin also verified The biggest issue honestly educating store employees As Apple Pay user I ve found always best never tell cashiers re paying Apple pay complicates things Even situations I tell I using Apple pay CC terminal wasn I could reach couldn get right I told like I m paying Credit Card This isn security They won release without secure I consider given This privacy Stores want know shopping builds profiles They Apple Pay loyalty cards implemented way

iPhone would clamouring make sure Blackberry Samsung anyone else cracked good American people didn brought task See NOTHING security American people EVERYTHING techno jingoism evident many statements Apple 1 FBI 0 ilk The method John McAfee proposed called social engineering nothing operating system encryption To put simple intelligent way guess indirectly obtain someone password If target still alive could sometime involve phone call attackers ability crack computer code Here famous example social engineering attack That original plan someone clued current reality guy dead John How Social Engineer password dead man John come better solution Ready especially HW SW Engineers I quote Now I ll probably lose admission world hackers community however I m gonna tell You need hardware engineer software engineer The hardware engineer takes phone apart sic copies instruction set iOS applications sic memory run piece program called disassembler takes ones zeroes gives readable instructions Then coder sits reads looking first access keypad first thing re input pad It ll take half hour When see reads instruction memory secret code stored It trivial A half hour Apple cannot make software designed ONLY break phone The software would able break ANY iPhone This software exist today Apple would create software sign unique signature allows install current version iOS something Apple Once software falls wrong hands hackers ANYONE phones Apple smart enough know create software hackers gunning obtain servers anyone distributed e FBI It takes 5 minutes Googling see FBI hacked plenty times Apple isn invulnerable either Once software lands wild ALL vulnerable Correct iPhones ONLY secure really strict guidelines place particularly locked Apple FBI servers cannot employ techniques would lose flexibility required job iPhones nature inflexible This Android fans talk iPhones dumb inflexible customizable They correct except dumb part subjective These qualities give type security even FBI get Our legal system works system precedents Once something decided court used benchmark law future Forcing Apple build software means legal precedent set Apple software companies forced make type software OVER OVER law enforcement The FBI Director James Comey told congressional intelligence UNDER OATH outcome likely guide courts handle similar requests If take mean Apple resource allocation estimates means would devote 8 employees 10 years handle issues currently queue But since would unacceptable let say cut 6 months They would need increase employees case factor 20 achieve That means Apple would allocate 160 employees next 6 months work current cases But Apple private company They work government They legal obligation work FBI way This important issue many people falsely misled emotional connection story media throwing around phrases like terrorist lives could saved But fact FBI simply wants software access data whenever want Our government proven whatever takes gain access data won stay within letter laws Google PRISM Surveillance Program info 1 They kept saying created warrant proof space doesn already exist You might able search house car I buried body information trying find hole ground middle forest What I tied rock threw ocean If I tell places pretty warrant proof In fact hide money question asked many crime movies And warrant doesn help cases 2 Issuing court order write software sounds pretty similar issuing court order force company develop faster light travel People may may working towards goal court order isn going make happen make possible The simple fact matter COURT issue warrant owner phone unlock device If refused thrown jail That one thing trying force APple write modified code unlock phones whole different matter Great article Thanks The Warrant proof Spaces scary one The FBI basically saying right eves drop wherever whenever Period You re entitled privacy I talking wife morning happens tech gets small enough implanted yeah I know SciFi stuff know worked Does government actually think ll right hack brains Well documents line says several 3 letter US agencies technology turn computer smartphones communications interfaces cameras

interpret think Windwalkers WWII bad They information served received That extent ANYONE including Apple forced To interpret sure ask Apple And anyone else one need comply FBI 2 Costs society NOT good argument Believe police arrest prosecute convict people without ANY electronic information The cost subpoena free zone FBI must work bad thing Look Dread Pirate Roberts Silk Road debacle No matter

Stingray worthless support criminals support privacy We clue government uses So cost Society lets get full accounting FBI abridged freedoms thus far go FBI 3 Ancient law still valid today The FBI electronics even around The founding fathers Washington signed never expected something like smartphone It become electronic priest spouse lot people It information one document location every likely require review century FBI 4 ish No way get data Does anyone really believe NSA crack encryption weeks hours My guess NSA didn want waste time And FBI thought TERRORISM way force apple case set precedent wait Drug Cases everything else Pedofiles wasn fearful enough mass shootings yeah thats ticket Forget worrying China fact Mr Director even think China Good Job Mr Director FBI 5 Apple hasn suggested way forward Because say I THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND It worst society proves best principles In case principles privacy freedom Apple stake And one wants say protect terrorist protect everyone They chose argument make Apple look bad know They bought terrorism pedofiloes notice didn mention drug cases also want phones unlocked Why won sensational Its dishonest cherry picking willful ignorance best Imagine member Congress lets call Senator Smith deciding whether support bill protect people privacy phones devices To allow secure communication encryption In back head knowledge next time runs opponent run ads saying Senator Smith voted protect pedophiles pictures children phones Senator Smith voted allow ISIS Cells operate neighborhood allowing law enforcement check communication As using date documents etc FBI cannot use All Writs americans stop hiding behind outdated document allows easy access guns many people would still alive today recent events privacy issue probably wouldnt happening right night I still stand fact agreeing Apples stance creating secure platform criminals terrorists etc use continue private anyone broadcasting views sites like social sites protecting privacy already giving away privacy care much stop using internet The founding fathers idea Constitution would applied centuries come That included amendment system The All Writs Act intended used time National Emergency isn limited scope isn It intended needed use cart borrow horse demand make us gunpowder It intended allow government force individual company redesign product make job easier They never intended free pass force us help whatever want A poor source information More point EVERYONE something hide If FBI hack phone computer tools escape Then anyone hack phone computer look financial records bank records personal correspondence etc etc This would far worse tool hands stalkers psychopaths jilted lovers This tool must made To great extent battle letting FBI It battle letting everyone yes nothing proposition As regards letting criminals etc use houses roads etc haha course warrant procedure allows police access house car laptop cause police pull logic police rights phone cause case cause So yes ideal world would go business one would care would obey law would perfect privacy live world everyone something hide people commit least one crime lifetime criminals exist people snap murder people dont deserve privacy would much rather continue watched knowing whatever evidence collected used put bad people behind bars I wasn able watch listen entire conference stupid job I m getting paid I managed catch Mr Issa comments I blown away The idea FBI could simply copy HDD phone couple thousand images brute force one destroys rather brilliant seems best simplest option Sir know disagree Apple certainly prerogative I would like advise instead repeating stance educate get facts straight While Internet cesspool lot noise I d suggest start reading

Discussing FBI case friend yesterday one distinction seems worth addressing difference backdoor iPhones law enforcement agencies far calling might term master key FBI calling particular case Again I emphasise I fully sympathize FBI intentions San Bernardino case If terrorists waiting launch similar attacks want know If iPhone could lead possible terrorists doesn seem unreasonable agree one request The problem however never Any time give one civil liberties good cause legal precedent set There second exception third Effectively permit single exception Constitutional right give right forever Some arguing sufficient safeguards case need worry Only Apple would hold key would use presented court order The FBI agencies would ability carry warrantless searches would likely seek court orders serious cases Again however need look beyond asked short term likely follow In particular case FBI wants Apple unlock phone Technically Apple would remove safeguards FBI would unlock phone semantic argument Apple continues hold key But extremely short distance arguing time critical cases delay involved knocking Apple door damaging The classic time bomber custody scenario That FBI needs hold key prevent delay It still wouldn without court order harm It would simply cutting middleman Ok could argue harm This nothing hide argument That re law abiding people fear government snooping phones As I ve argued however silly argument If take line could equally argue everyone fitted GPS chip embedded skin track movements blanket CCTV coverage every street every building But even would trust government much power isn one government consider The USA almost certainly agreements friendly governments share certain technologies iPhone master key could well join list History shows country considered ally today may well enemy tomorrow Even prepared risk getting away fact terrorists may evil generally stupid In San Bernardino case appears shooters destroyed phones hard drives FBI somehow hoping might still left incriminating evidence work phone Do doubt wit use strong passcode Terrorists major criminals use burner phones plan attacks iPhones registered names using Apple IDs There evidence FBI able enter phone If gunman smart enough destroy phones remove drive computer I d bet money used four number passcode That makes brute forcing project would take far long FBI complete This case one thing The government wants spy citizens You mention FBI sharing key law enforcement agencies I suspect copy would go NSA day made They several decades history illegal spying Americans Why government hand phone Apple let Apple extract data even supervision FBI agents specialists Then government gets data software tools Apple uses doesn get public domain Granted Apple create software make work government appears willing pay There rarely facet life Whether one drink one affair one potato chip nature something makes easier us easier continue Sure long Apple kept house sole provider service Apple would obviously ordered court solves problem courts government snooping people lives Apple already provides data access required court order Apple compliant turning tools government crack iPhone security puts risks abuse government risks entering public domain Hypothetically let say dev team asked build signed compromised firmware There might 10 people team would need access order build test ship Knowing thing exists would know valuable thing would black market also NSA may well consider thing given proven track record Anyway d asking generate ipsw file couple gigs would wrong hands render every iPhone planet using four six digit passcode trivially crackable And d asking promise accidentally let copy walk door make way sold darknet Meanwhile anyone something criminal actually hide still use minutes OpenSSL create encrypted data NSA couldn crack ten lifetimes I matter transmit The victim normal citizens get hacked trivially steal identities private photos There nothing could said would make support master key backdoor option Plain simple case perfect FBI try use accomplish goal Then go follow right procedures FBI agents human long human nature factor abuses technology guaranteed Only case prosecution come abuse FBI agents thing hacker one goes jail Yes I would argue Terrorist phone cracked I wouldn want Osama Bin Ladin phone cracked They get everything need ways damage us FAR great Terrorism whatever government doesn want people Today psycho school shooter may may terrorist depending prays color skin Don bore stop terrorism argument Never Never Freedom freedom Tyranny tyranny Well I frequent poster I Facebook account matter social interaction web site accounts It I m hiding anything life boring hell would interested I day day I feel need post daily bathroom routine So precludes much post Sharing Generation I however great stake seeing Constitution Bill Rights followed take time read understand much published last 4 5 years see US Government either rode rough shod pulled legal loopholes around flat circumvented governing rules attempts Know All See All Predict All guise National Security name designed make us feel safer I think re missing bigger point It personal data like Tinder Facebook activity phone would jeopardy If someone able access phone via master key backdoor would immediately gain access Credit cards I use Apple Pay access iCloud storage contains tax records private data access email accounts could used gain access bank accounts etc Pretty much someone get cell phone access almost everything identity THAT I want anyone access except Exactly Its I ve saying along Its issue devices including cloud accounts becoming vulnerable hackers especially ones countries Last world I need identity stolen I m sure banks getting lawyers cover asses event gets real easy accounts The problem however never Any time give one civil liberties good cause legal precedent set There second exception third Effectively permit single exception Constitutional right give right forever So supposed believe one phone holds key uncovering homegrown terrorist plots something FBI deemed practically impossible So 300 400 pieces evidence live cooperative Co conspiritor aren enough provide clues tips plots single iPhone Seriously Judge removed granting order This clearly BS attempt piggyback The FBI goals tragic poorly planned executed event Firstly shouldn give constitutional rights side atlantic give art 8 ECHR right privacy Any access lawful court order No warrant access And I mean warrant access specific phone phones general warrant access want That clearly covered human rights convention I understand search warrant covered US constitution Second master key hands Apple FBI If want access specific phone send phone warrant Apple No warrant access I d like see act congress act parliament saying key stays Apple FBI NSA demand future NSA etc wrong mass monitoring every phone Now Apple wrong saying access zero phones even court order Both sides need heads knocking together find middle ground protects ordinary peoples privacy whilst allowing access phone criminals It irresponsible get create And number access familiarity go continue maintain branch code iOS upgrades The thing makes Apple better FBI hold corporate incentive want however personal incentive leak still aren people security clearance background checks First I say I think Tim Cook statement course action respect demand right way go However I disagree author right way go The author article well many commentators basing arguments flawed principles justice government process First importance rights cannot emphasized enough trumps lowercase Trumps never Rights expectations lives liberty met ABSENT good reason The compelling right circumstances drastic potential consequences compelling reason must In way law care outcome much cares process That reasons action e g demanding apple create master key careful deliberations Many rights expressly stated Constitution built hedge words e g unreasonable search Other rights least partially product judicial creativity privacy fundamental rights implicitly hedged judicial practice In sense long judiciary approves government action right infringed The expectation privacy respected superseded allegedly least compelling circumstances Often people confuse term rights personal ideals think nation observe I blame I probably saying stuff years ago However I learn rights I understand unworkable flawed truly unyielding right could Second article uses flawed narrative device commonly employed politicians even sometimes legal scholars That device known slippery slope The idea immediate proposal may extremely offensive marks beginning end It effective tool logically unsound little lazy unrealistic If Supreme Court used reasoning degree change status quo would unacceptable Any opponent could argue slightly increased taxes wealthiest Americans unacceptable start pattern burdensome tax increases wealthy Americans none left Others may use slippery slope argument rebut proposals ease sentences non violent drug offenders symbolizes beginning era United States embraces encourages substance abuse addiction The fact government called upon make choices controversial overtones ask apply best judgment Here I agree Tim Cook To quote message We challenging FBI demands deepest respect American democracy love country We believe would best interest everyone TO STEP BACK AND CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS emphasis added He saying never comply order appealing deliberation commentary oversight He believes right stake important enough challenge order provoke deliberation oversight And absolutely right The heightened expectation privacy digital devices recently discussed Supreme Court Riley v California I m sure Tim Cook continue challenge long either comfortable increased attention oversight company face potential consequences cannot afford accept Explicit message acknowledgement respect compelling circumstances hand Sure evidence yet phone anything useful But fact evidence produced yet necessarily mean government interest device compelling To claim contrary armchair fair weak I m certainly defaming FBI As I say I sympathy position believe good intentions case But slippery slope argument absolutely applies realistic prospect would one case would lead long run tool filtering law enforcement bodies On wider point I agree often make difficult decisions This one I absolutely appreciate possible someone else come side argument I wouldn call argument logically unsound unrealistic lazy I d appreciate courtesy return To fair slippery slope argument ALWAYS applies That problem The problem largely discredited logical tool product knee jerk reaction product reasoned judgment When disfavored policies proposed emotion often comes reasoning We feel icky brain scrambles justification icky feeling I want Wikipedia scholar look slippery slope You see I mean It says device incite fear supported historical anecdotes The Wikipedia article also great citations UCLA Harvard Law review articles point flaw slippery slope It opinion slippery slope arguments invalid It widely accepted slipper slope arguments generally invalid All I m saying opinion article would much better relied credible principles I think balanced writer Again I agree larger issue I fully support Apple challenge And I also completely sympathize others think reasonable exception likely lead large scale policies erode privacy But I think I reserve right point flaws argument Donald Trump argument stated simply Who think I would call lazy unreasonable Lots people would Some supporters may think argument completely called possibly MOST reasonable position It I think side still highly intelligent compassionate person As I said earlier reply process They re always plausible Ben But compounding series plausible events becomes shot dark And support statement like everything I said follow shot dark I understand impulse I guarantee slippery slope argument nothing special It pretty text book Let start saying I agree scenario wherein FBI possession locked phone belonging terrorist suspected terrorist probably inevitability So let assume case goes Supreme Court uphold FBI demand Apple complies The biggest jump gloss FBI certainly eventually hold key unlocking devices facilitate administrative convenience There lot missing steps Although privacy rights yield circumstances emergency law still favors privacy administrative convenience Urging Apple unlock device requiring master key possession FBI This would long hill battle FBI even goal And although FBI interested efficient investigations I think fair point assume would even ask indefinite possession master key Yes everyone point dragnet etc show government agencies respect privacy rights bit prejudicial overbroad The FBI respect legal process civil liberties think Even FBI eventually ask possession master key without assistance company question whole legal battle The FBI unbridled possession master key inconsequential revision initial decision unlock single phone It impossible may proposed But step alone actually big series steps one I m fine calling plausible Then deviate slightly main point posit nothing hide argument automatically favors ubiquitous monitoring every citizen use tracking devices etc I like nothing hide argument either much valid arguments come little thought You achieve article hypotheticals law abiding citizens sometimes DO something worth hiding It takes many assumptions HUGE margins error come conclusion action means privacy privacy affected Those margins error accumulate mean shot dark I m saying single one steps absurd They plausible The immediate case really privacy The government able get warrants search electronic devices long time The government warrant iPhone violate privacy right inspecting contents The right privacy amalgam rights either expressly written Constitution created Judges hard define even law professors Of course lots people heard phrase right privacy devised conclusion means It hard understand individuals would upset government action violates thought part right privacy I m saying nation idea privacy ideal It made lots smart people course And seems pretty critical good civic life The immediate case whether government force company individual assist inspection article within possession And whether ability limits especially company assistance forces disobey standard conduct towards consumers assistance could potentially pose risk consumers data One thing Stingray PRISM etc There significant difference secret uses government power demand made legal process subject judicial discretion public scrutiny Yes branches government grossly abused power resources without complying legal requirements e g obtaining warrants Here government warrant It seems like danger leaking WILL leak made far greater even likelihood hypothetically helping ANYONE stupid criminal would use 4 6 digit passcode protect phone anything incriminating useful could use complex alphanumeric one better yet use easily available tools encrypt important communications desktop computer simply third party app third party ever able decrypt Data protected key mechanism would significantly secure medical financial information much easier protect government abuse compared homes even bodies And appointing Apple gatekeeper possibility hold government entities accountable abuses fact event fraud used obtain warrant As know terrorism excuse need new laws prohibit blanket perpetually classified warrants Obviously Apple admits gatekeeper demanded governments including due process barriers However since Apple clearly perform function better custodian private data forced Terrorist masterminds privacy absolutists accept Apple promise keep secrets store outside Apple ecosystem It bit work UI may esthetically pleasing The rest us bad protecting data impact There may middle ground issue phone encryption Instead master key back door encryption could adjusted known level quality The encryption level would selected extremely powerful government computers could decrypt reasonable amount time This way government could decrypt cell phone data would able limited number devices per year Over time encryption level would increase I mind idea government could decrypt data really wanted I want decrypt data I want anyone else able personal computers least long time Correct I m wrong method would work iOS7 I heard security podcast would could apply iOS8 If case harm How many iPhones 7 The danger privacy negligable Pretending practical difference backdoor master key unhelpful That makes FBI case Encryption without way prevent device wiping encryption trust And way ensure key stolen misused mention fact exists countries demand thing And written confirmed clear NOT single device requested

prevail certain would back next time arguing since Apple already created compromised firmware legal precedent help break iPhones Which problem type case Despite general views I specific case San Bernardino shootings find sympathy FBI But I consider broader principle important But factor I could see weighing response lack one rest tech industry While judiciary theoretically independent judges blind direction political winds blowing If large tech companies like Google Microsoft came strong support Apple position may well help persuade court position reasonable one made position clear back December distinct lack response Cook letter rest tech industry Android phones encrypted similar way iPhones Google clearly supports encryption principle know company attitude specific situation like one But I m lawyer There plenty available Apple certainly afford best Cook bold response also makes clear likely fight one way Supreme Court necessary And moment makes rather unpredictable forum So ll see Apple got trapped predictable corner current policy obstructing everything even court order matter serious case There chance going stand long term To protect public safety protect privacy customers need start taking reasonable position otherwise going lose No apple reasonable look way apple gate company government asked gaps apples gates would see gate company reacting request standing customers privacy compromising safety millions case one person Well isn Apples point right tools break someones phone But government asks help develop tool And Cook says soon tool exists could get wrong hands whole system compromised The way sure one breaks providing tools Seems reasonable I still use flip phone swear Charge battery twice week fits front pocket indestructible works great I always need phone always need web email wifi ubiquitous iTouch fine I carry back pocket needed Besides I m geezer I never wanted FBI given sort capability warrant I d like see Apple develop secure system devices warrant go Apple accessed via cryptographically secure recovery key No warrant access No built capability FBI anyone else randomly access phone want But Apple interested obstructive finding secure solution The FBI picked case well illustrate sort investigation Apples products set obstruct I d like see similar warrants example child abuse cases ensure Apple play victim The victims 14 people shot dead Apple What describe impossible Have nice day You create backdoor one group You create everyone Additionally proposing would honestly create bidding war cracking Secure System essence would destroy point encryption first place Even scenario would begin Apple holding key law enforcement agencies would argue time essence cases need hold key US govt undoubtedly agreements friendly governments share certain technical resources governments copies key friendly govts like Saudi Arabia But bigger problem logically US access Apple international operations based Ireland The UK parliamentary sovereignty system triple checks prevent anyone changing law What China They standing warrant search citizens possessions devices diaries thoughts Exactly right First US govt agencies get immediately Then goes Five Eyes govts UK Canada Australia New Zealand Then NATO France Germany Italy yes Turkey East European countries Then yes Saudi Israel South Korea Japan Mexico allies necessity Then demands get Brazil India Russia legitimate reasons similar difficult cases justify releasing allies eventually leak every iPhone cracked government government allied corporation anywhere Basically private corporations cannot guarantee encryption failed approach definition Corporations neither resist legislative court pressure countries operate certainly ones based motivate persons take great personal risks protect data I d comfortable Law Society Bar Association Catholic Church Greenpeace MSF Occupy holding private keys hardware application vendor As operating systems open source many distributions like Linux choose hardware OS separately adopt level encryption required application need Yes means criminals use In fact use talk lawyers Which shouldn able see either Your recommendation completely myopic premised US law around warrants Many perhaps due process restricts around law enforcement Anywhere Apple operates company employees subject local governments demands decrypt iPhones This isn slippery slope situation The fact matter If Apple ability Apple cannot refuse The issue beyond whether method already versus would forced develop something It whether whether reasonably How much time many resources Apple devote design create test one version OS Cost labor isn really issue resources taken away real projects could impact company business model products sell Then putting hands fbi concerns happens I would point addition everything everyone else rightly logically pointed NO ONE point called Apple victim Not even Apple played victim You re obvious anti Apple bias true lack real fundamental understanding software cryptography works astounding want take harsh stance company Would expect company made control garage door opener button could press instantly open garage door made company No course If government gets warrant onus find way open door In US anyway protected self incrimination We protected forced surrender incriminating evidence hands police This cannot required even warrant If safe home police come search warrant cannot require give combination access The onus Weakening security phone phone 99 9999 phone users able get information 0001 completely insane inherently dangerous Imagine damage people property security economy suddenly hackers easy access personal information The FBI making remarkable claim without supporting evidence Apple create signed hacked firmware ever work single iPhone Something like iphone serial number whatever invoke delay wrong passcode But serial number determined What FBI hackers defeat check somehow Once create back door ve dramatically weakened security every iPhone I think likely legal shade thrown Apple soon overcome public good shame govt types soon start heaping Apple This quickly turn You re helping terrorists baby rapists cry Congress worse already done The Law Order types rally side Apple Unfortunately see current state US politics angry mob much potent thing Of course kind conspiracy theory aficionado sort guy I expect absolutely intention start The authoritarians need squelch free speech crypto freedom speech 2nd Amendment arms government types fighting prevalence since PGP publicly SINCE And lest anyone start throwing terms like Republican Democrat realize issue re group authoritarians They already succeeded resisting first place Eventually give least come compromise My advice would demand phone de cryption give FBI access phone software If FBI wants data get site 1 infinite loop supervision Apple Engineers That phone doesn leave Apple HQ software compromise security phones Just government wants something doesn mean done Privacy valuable thing many protected While I agree Apple likely lose battle ridiculous battle government trying uncover one dead man data turning blind eye repercussions impact company business especially privacy American citizens I predict next major iOS version released Apple make impossible install new old firmware even DFU mode without first entering PIN case ve forgotten PIN accepting forcing install without PIN wipe data device Once new firmware running device would impossible Apple make new firmware image FBI etc could installed without first providing PIN wiping data If impossible Apple avoids forced something future Regardless whether Apple moral high ground issue I believe ve pursued right strategy response Courts going measure policy implications forcing Apple bypass security iPhone They re going balance burden Apple versus public interest unlocking device criminal investigation Apple let process play formal legal process tried launch public relations policy discussion Ultimately get make final decision ve put position 1 hero agree 2 law breaker disagree Principled stands great usually particularly effective strategy short term What bad Apple already technical way unlock device refusing privacy grounds They get decide neither USA Privacy doesn trump due process In fact due process warrants used overcome privacy interests Privacy trump On principal It interesting fight least I hope fight A good test freedoms privacy US today Apple money get best lawyers political weight mega corporation let see But strikes nobody said FBI request seems like trying take shortcuts What wrong rolling sleeves good old fashioned legwork first Have really exhausted resources already How even know phone contains evidence haven found evidence crack case Has anyone asked Are really ready take next step towards guarantees personal freedom order give FBI chance see phone might something could even little use trying solve crime I see people making allegation exactly judge issuing order third party requiring assist complying warrant overstepping power judge A federal judge absolutely power open questions 1 order overly burdensome third party 2 underlying warrant invalid I suspect little dispute validity warrant case re unduly burdensome question Or perhaps It seems notable FBI seeking force Apple break phone one two perpetrators Why A likely explanation shooter used Android phone Google voluntarily cooperated FBI helping gain access My opinion somewhat torn I value privacy great deal Now looking closely action took place I think Apple shouldn give custom OS get phone decrypt give back The reason I support 5C everything encrypted level even Apple open 5S starting die Considering circumstances I actually wouldn problem process The US government even secure systems yet want us compromise order A big FK U completely appropriate They already phone records phone question need follow trail We spending 10 billions dollars national security every year expect job resources already Period As tragic incident reality 10 thousands people killed every year via guns country This brand terrorism Let try dealing well keep things proper perspective Right Not mention phone question unlikely valuable intelligence since terrorists destroyed phones hard drives I d rather see debated another context I imagine way give privacy limited way help national security wouldn open pandora box Apple right stand I suppose judge could also order Apple hand private key iPhone firmware source code FBI could hire hackers create malicious back doored firmware That would effectively disable security every iPhone world Apple revokes old key Ready set FIGHT I think chances real useful information gained slim none I also think infringing rights worth Not even prevents major terror incident I think phone records showing cell location call history plenty invasive enough lives already This may expose text messages GOOD Plus I d imagine something hide go steps hide history probably hiding intentions movements anyway If Apple sticks guns I see OS upgrades painful future They place somewhere phone firmware code automatically wipe information iOS device BEFORE allows upgrade If phone initially keep subsequent iOS releases Apple say phone firmware prevents anything special loaded won wipe phone That way Apple would forced create custom software could simply installed top normal OS allowing anyone get phone But would make upgrades really inconvenient us lot data phones And would make phone upgrades worthless d still attach iTunes restore data Keep mind iCloud stores essentials data Anytime upgrade phone would wiped clean Background checks iPhone purchases Anyone lol This similar position gun control actually If someone killed gun go guns manufacturer Why start root issue Maybe intelligence community needs better monitoring channels Even Apple caves opens iPhones government agencies still hundreds alternate messaging apps encrypt data many many ways bad guys keep bad guys The thing allowing government access exactly article speculates allow tools leak hands others shouldn tools Nothing ever leaks Apple Government Done For dismissing Apple vociferous defense freedom arguments child could saved violating liberty I hold line Freedom comes great danger great risks reward liberty Give liberty PDA State accessible back door This court decision upheld end U S leadership technology All people want security devices purchase companies business countries allow secure technology exist demand open government access devices makes devices insecure Our FBI courts anti American efforts make devices insecure destroy U S leadership
