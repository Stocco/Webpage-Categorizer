Tech companies partly encouraged elision artificial intelligence sci fi AI especially anthropomorphic digital assistants useful comes understanding computers new exciting With mind primer aims explain commonly used terms consumer applications artificial intelligence well looking limitations current technology shouldn worrying robot uprising yet These three terms re likely heard lately simple possible think layers Neural networks bottom re type computer architecture onto artificial intelligence built Machine learning next program might run neural network training computers look certain answers pots data deep learning top particular type machine learning become popular past decade largely thanks two new resources cheap processing power abundant data otherwise known internet The concept neural networks goes way back 50s beginning AI field research In nutshell networks way structuring computer looks like cartoon brain comprised neuron like nodes connected together web Individually nodes dumb answering extremely basic questions collectively tackle difficult problems More importantly right algorithms taught With conventional programming would give precise set rules telling look left right wait cars use pedestrian crossings etc let go With machine learning d instead show 10 000 videos someone crossing road safely 10 000 videos someone getting hit car let thing Over past couple decades people tried sorts different methods try teach computers These methods include example reinforcement learning give computer reward thing want gradually optimizing best solution genetic algorithms competing methods solving problem pitted one another manner comparable natural selection In today classrooms computers one teaching method become particularly useful deep learning type machine learning uses lots layers neural network analyze data different abstractions So deep learning system looking picture layer essentially tackling different magnification The bottom layer might look 5 x 5 grids pixels answering simply yes whether something shows grid If answers yes layer looks see grid fits larger pattern Is beginning line example corner This process gradually builds allowing software understand even complicated data breaking constituent parts Next let imagine want teach computer cat looks like using deep learning First d take neural network program different layers identify different elements cat claws paws whiskers etc Each layer would built layers allow recognize particular element called deep learning Then network shown lot images cats animals told This cat tell computer showing picture cat This also cat This As neural network sees different images different layers nodes within light recognize claws paws whiskers etc Over time remembers layers important aren strengthening connections disregarding others It might discover paws example strongly correlated cats also appear things cats learns look paws also appear alongside whiskers This long iterative process system slowly getting better based feedback Either human correct computer nudging right direction Or network large enough pot labeled data test seeing different weightings layers produce accurate answers Now imagine many steps needed say whether something cat think complex systems recognize well everything else exists world That Microsoft proud However deep learning proved adept tasks involving speech image recognition stuff lots commercial applications also plenty limitations Not deep learning techniques require lot data fine tuning work intelligence narrow brittle As cognitive psychologist Gary Marcus acquiring abstract ideas like sibling identical They obvious ways performing logical inferences also still long way integrating abstract knowledge information objects typically used In words common sense neural network used generate picture dumbbell trained sample images The pictures dumbbells produced pretty good two gray circles connected horizontal tube But middle weight muscular outline bodybuilder arm This pictures network trained often shown bodybuilder holding dumbbell Deep learning might able work common visual properties tens thousands pictures dumbbells would never make cognitive leap say dumbbells arms These sorts problems aren limited common sense either Because way examine data deep learning networks also These sorts limitations artfully hidden though Take new wave digital assistants like Siri example often seem like understand us answering questions setting alarms telling preprogrammed jokes quips along way But computer scientist Hector Levesque points quirks show big gap AI real intelligence Levesque uses points machines best challenge rely tricks make people think re talking human They use jokes quotations emotional outbursts misdirection manner verbal dodges confuse distract questioners And indeed machine said publications A better test AI domain says Levesque would quiz machines surreal logical questions demand sort wide causal knowledge Marcus describes Levesque offers example questions like Could crocodile run steeplechase Should baseball players allowed glue small wings onto caps Imagine sort things computer would know even attempt answer soon machines conquered task previously humans could whether playing chess recognizing faces longer considered mark intelligence As computer scientists Larry Tesler put Intelligence whatever machines haven done yet And even tasks computers beat aren replicating human intelligence When say neural network like brain true says LeCun It true way airplanes aren like birds They flap wings feathers muscles If create intelligence says won like human intelligence animal intelligence It difficult us imagine example intelligent entity impulse towards self preservation Many people working within field AI dismissive idea ll ever able create artificial intelligence truly sentient There approach moment hope flexible performing multiple tasks going beyond basic tasks programmed Professor Andrei Barbu MIT Center Brains Minds Machines told adding effective AI research creating systems fine tuned solve specific problem He says although forays unsupervised learning systems work data hasn labeled way work still infancy One better known examples fed random YouTube thumbnails 10 million videos Eventually taught cat looked like creators make wider claims ability As LeCun said event Orange Institute last year We know unsupervised learning That biggest obstacle Artificial intelligence field study also tendency fall victim hype It often happens new method found progress made quickly commentators often computer scientists make bold claims rate improvement continue ve created robot butlers Just take example describes early form AI machine tell difference left right electronic embryo one day able walk talk see write reproduce conscious existence When sorts promises aren fulfilled field tends fall known AI winter period pessimism

Today I m excited announce I ve joined Google When meeting current former Googlers I continually find drawn intelligence passion enthusiasm well universal desire share others I m also impressed Google commitment enabling talented people tackle world interesting important problems I wait contribute experience dozen years building online communities begin next chapter career incredible company Last month I executed documents formally dissolve failed startup Canvas Networks The documents included provision donate remaining capital 40 000 charity company rsquo intellectual property open sourced When I originally announced company rsquo demise I noted failed business product At time DrawQuest thriving drawing community 400 000 monthly users I felt shame shutter app could conceivably continue operate another year remaining capital I requested received blessing investors defer dissolution continue operating app even team moved It hope addition right community perhaps app would one day become popular enough viable business someone would come along take app continue mission I figured better optimize possibility value creation road however unlikely extinguish possibility dissolving company firesale ing assets immediately Unfortunately dream cut short three months later company rsquo Amazon Web Services account broken likely Bitcoin miner Without full time employees perform full scale security audit rebuild metal felt prudent course action disable service immediately notify users breach As consequence sudden shutdown members community lost access incredible artwork 10 million drawings total And decided defer dissolution time task recovering community rsquo artwork With assistance former backend developer launched complete web archive allowed users browse galleries profiles existed app We gave 30 days access archive download ZIP file artwork also provided Archive org copy data With obligation fulfilled I scrambled wind company year end investors could close books I could tie four half year long chapter life This consisted mainly paperwork also deciding company rsquo remaining assets Before announcing company rsquo failure January I rsquo d spent months trying find home team product avail With team rsquo disbanding AWS account compromise subsequent shuttering app I found extremely unlikely rsquo d find buyer IP I acquired personally intention open sourcing company rsquo work GitHub I especially remember challenging build refine drawing tool portion app hope others benefit team rsquo hard work And selfishly I hope somebody consider reviving DrawQuest even single player experience I still miss dearly After settling outstanding liabilities company left roughly 40 000 capital I reasoned one cent dollar return unlikely move needle shareholders since divided proportionally based ownership single investor would receive significant amount money dissolution However sum aggregate potential meaningful charitable organization I asked investors waive liquidity preference allow donate remaining money charity received unanimous support The designated beneficiary Free Arts NYC organization provides disadvantaged children access art programs continues DrawQuest rsquo mission helping people develop become confident creative abilities Throughout entire process I rsquo ve one goal mind create positive outcomes every step way many people possible given I wasn rsquo able generate venture return investors It rsquo weight I still carry day I take solace knowing I able provide best possible outcome employees users developer community local community None would possible without shared outlook agreed rather unconventional requests I surprised learn investors hadn rsquo seen leftover capital donated way This probably two reasons first founders rarely ask also could considered tension firm rsquo fiduciary responsibility limited partners ultimately accountable I understand neither venture firms LPs charitable organizations I rsquo help think better ways handle dissolutions would see immaterial amounts money returned fund Perhaps provision could added future partnership agreements removes conflict giving firms greater flexibility waiving liquidity preference designating beneficiary returns situations would move needle fund could impactful non profit worthy cause My intention isn rsquo preach provide alternative usual startup dissolution rarely leaves smile anyone rsquo face benefits society I rsquo feel satisfaction would making charitable contribution money wasn rsquo deep I feel I created value possible stakeholders given circumstances debt gratitude investors LPs allowing I felt heart ldquo right rdquo Thank As teen I enjoyed sending handmade cards faraway friends I spent hours meticulously cutting glueing together pieces card stock usually without faintest idea make write I produced something liking I let hands thinking When I graduated high school went college I cardmaking A recent lengthy e mail correspondence reminded uncommon write letters delight It also made question way I currently interact people digital world something already mind I recalibrate priorities life Over past months I ve removed unnecessary apps devices I stopped idling Google Chat AIM IRC latter two services I d used almost daily 15 years refreshing inbox less often A handful objectively unnecessary apps survived purge though including Facebook Twitter In effort decrease time spent social media I ve found I use selfishly These days I open social apps I something share feels uncomfortably narcissistic The immediate praise comes form likes faves tempt even care My ability live moment enjoy everyday life also diminished since I tend snap photos fumble phone instead enjoying hand Nick Bilton 2012 New Year Resolution comes mind resonates ever I love taking photos though I ve come appreciate unshared photo meaningful one Don get wrong I prefer stay touch friends keep apprised lives But I miss richness interactions would much rather catch someone face face least true correspondence rather peek life distorted lens social media posts The time energy I spend streaming disjointed snippets consciousness social media would undoubtedly better spent writing sharing cohesive written works And better private platforms journaling primarily I use social media So today Facebook Twitter apps join purge replaced trusty pencil notebook paper If notice less social media I hope know I m still around eagerly await welcome letters Or bicycle ride walk park even reading beside one another anything tweet As name blog suggests I love hate relationship writing I ve never able sit make words flow Almost writing blog post 4chan news post important e mail comes together bits pieces course days weeks sometimes

miswording misunderstanding I strive clear concise This writing process treated well enough years except hasn I struggle meet writing deadlines especially self imposed ones one point went four years without publishing 4chan news post I remained silent site grew changed dramatically I wanted words wouldn come Writing skill I hope cultivate lifetime The ability communicate clearly incredible asset expressing oneself writing reveals things thoughts alone often cannot And extremely visual spatial thinker making thoughts tangible gives meaning As everything practice necessary improvement I took blogging I ve also paying closer attention prose authors I admire Recent favorites include Antoine de Saint Exup\xc3\xa9ry Wind Sand Stars Maciej Ceg\xc5\x82owski travel writing Emulating another author writing style mistake since finding voice critical expanding one repertoire wonders helping craft voice If write regularly I d strongly encourage give try I ve found especially therapeutic following dissolution startup generally helped better understand share friends family public Believe I Good luck Today I rsquo m embarking first solo trip I frequently travel ldquo alone rdquo work

given 2010 Every rsquo re presented opportunities dramatically alter path life I think branching points ROFLCon 2008 probably one best best things happened Before attending conference meeting minds interested nascent ldquo Internet culture quot I zero friends involved building websites communities I struggling second year college felt bored isolated Richmond Virginia At ROFLCon I introduced dozens people shared enthusiasm corner Web I stimulated three days I rsquo d years soaked excitement curiosity permeated event I spent following week couchsurfing around Cambridge auditing classes Harvard MIT returned Richmond long enough pack belongings move Cambridge That summer 4chan unveiled mainstream public via profiles TIME The Wall Street Journal life took new course Although I ultimately moved home New York I look back summer one formative still count many friendships born ROFLCon closest Sometimes I wonder life would different I made one decision versus another I firmly believe regrets past So long rsquo re happy present rsquo nothing regret past And rsquo re happy present feeling regret won rsquo change The future set looking forward backward learning past refusing hamstrung As enter second half 2014 I rsquo help feel I rsquo m middle latest branching point People generally underestimate much rsquo ll change coming years I safely say I rsquo ve changed past months I past five years Not terms core I I interact world I want life In retrospect maybe failure startup second best worst thing happened We rsquo usually get decide opportunities present form rsquo ll take keep open mind ready embrace I rsquo m certainly glad I hope I rsquo ll continue Everybody deserves safe place relax reflect happy place My happy place weekend community garden Northern California At home New York cycling along Hudson River dusk As lifelong urban dweller I m increasingly finding nature I m glad found places unwind think touched others share Feel free reblog share One cherished possessions father rsquo old film camera It rsquo particularly rare valuable cycling shutter captured first moments life childhood family shy thirty years My phone alone contains 10 000 photos Its storage capacity often teeters full I find regularly going weed duplicates free space It rsquo little annoying I love Scrolling album spans seven years life akin time travel Last night I made fews years back overwhelmed memories relationships work travel It also reminded lucky I afforded great friendships opportunities life I take many photos invoke strong memory recall especially

rsquo spend leisure time wisely Stick front computer internet connection I rsquo ll amaze ability make time evaporate little nothing show Suffice say really bothers As someone doesn rsquo believe afterlife I feel I owe spend little time I happy healthy surrounded people I love Squandering finite time doesn rsquo sit well So I made following chart I feel ridiculous sharing I hope rsquo ll keep accountable maybe help someone else process It rsquo comprised two parts list ldquo approved rdquo daily physical non physical activities represent productive ways spending time flowchart help knock

enjoy spending downtime In nutshell kind people I keep close bring best I turn bring best I rsquo believe concept ldquo one rdquo friends dating I believe people rsquo re naturally compatible union represents whole greater sum parts I rsquo m lucky surrounded many amazing people already grateful allowing part lives never stop searching I spent holiday weekend friends cabin upstate New York We

Festival talk 18 36 rsquo bear hear drone ldquo learn things rdquo North Star life While 4chan hasn rsquo financially rewarding I rsquo ve accumulated enough experiences opportunities relationships last lifetime My startup objectively failure similarly rewarding I wouldn rsquo trade either experience anything That said I rsquo help feel I spent past four years neglecting I took ldquo always working rdquo mantra heart spent many sleepless nights trying figure grow company That meant agonizing daily App Annie e mails Google Analytics dashboards As company wound I felt like I drowning For first time years I free spend time however I saw fit I hated thought felt like going running 100 miles hour dead halt And I drowning person would I grasped desperately anything might keep afloat That meant scheduling meetings back back exploring employment opportunities I quickly became busier I running company burnt within weeks It took close friend slap back reality view absence full time job blessing curse To embrace opportunity recharge make calculated decisions future instead spontaneous ones To focus first time nearly four years Another much older friend challenged think 50 What would I excited tell younger self life I rsquo d led I haven rsquo come great answer I know doesn rsquo involve wealth material possessions something I find incredibly liberating I want comfortable happy To end I plan spend foreseeable future investing learning I hope spend time away computer activities I already enjoy like cycling cooking learning new ones like dance gardening As someone stubborn stiff I want place situations force outside comfort zone I want spend time people different learn build strong relationships That said I find great work extremely gratifying hope I return sabbatical sorts I rsquo ll clearer sense spend time going forward Everything table including especially things related traditionally wheelhouse Web Every day I rsquo m reminded important problems rsquo solved 0s 1s called ldquo hard rdquo problems I rsquo m qualified solve rsquo precisely point taking time acquire new skills learn world I rsquo already know Or maybe I rsquo ll become pilot volunteer worker trail guide knows That rsquo excites I rsquo quite know I rsquo m looking I rsquo wait find Waking string missed calls rarely harbinger good time would prove different Upon returning calls I greeted simple ldquo You rsquo ve hacked rdquo Great It turned someone username spent morning causing ruckus 4chan At first users moderators assumed I rsquo d drinking 7 00AM less quickly concluded work intruder I immediately hopped bed onto call developer moderator establish timeline events set digging error logs It didn rsquo take long piece together happened First intruder able enumerate files domain hosting moderator tools He used shelf script benefit leaked source code possession build site specific wordlist Mistake 1 No rate limiting HTTP auth dialog present domain Most enumerated files good since made use PHP auth check one file different instead displaying error message simply bounced front page He manually set 4chan admin username cookie cookie name gleaned source code voila longer redirected Mistake 2 The PHP auth check particular file broken The page question used generate statistics reported posts ldquo 0 days rdquo displayed page guessed might query parameter He correct turned one parameter vulnerable SQL injection After testing realized able return information database using error messages displayed Mistake 3 Unescaped SQL query disabling MySQL errors production Using injection vulnerability able exfiltrate information backend database Thankfully record information accessed thanks handy error messages logged appears mostly poked around settling accessing moderator credentials He took username password set cookies confirmed worked visiting admin panel main site began lurking Mistake 4 Boneheaded cookie auth simply stored bcrypted password database cookie required pass PHP auth After lurking days intruder decided make known publicly shaming user username He later stated motivation gaining entry along user disliked Using admin panels also able obtain leak information users well moderator names IP addresses We quickly patched vulnerability forced password reset moderator accounts spent past two weeks reviewing code servers apply fixes make improvements possible The day didn rsquo end though This next bit concerns DrawQuest I loaded e mail first time morning top list message Amazon ldquo Unauthorized activity AWS account rdquo To make already long story short leaving company months ago one developers asked open source project worked You probably already guess going suffice say flipping existing repository public Despite overwritten AWS keys still available commit history likely recovered bot An intruder able use create administrator account giving access AWS dashboard used spin hundred extra large instances probably Bitcoin mining They also would access S3 buckets EC2 RDS instances DNS etc Mistake 5 Not creating fresh repo newly open sourced project least scrubbing commit history Mistake 6 Using highly privileged key lesser privileged one would sufficed For DrawQuest catastrophic Despite team going separate ways months ago rsquo d hoped continue operating app using company rsquo remaining capital However without full time employees left staff breach felt responsible path forward shutter service completely since lack time resources complete audit order ensure integrity servers Amazon account And last night lump throat I announced rsquo d shutting DrawQuest beloved drawing community still boasted 100 000 monthly active users It long day say least On one hand I rsquo m frustrated made simple mistakes resulted real consequences also grateful provided us opportunity learn mistakes share world There rsquo silver bullet comes security way stay ahead constant vigilance Don rsquo rely one method protect

past ten plus years I extremely excited I see lot convictions represented Evan Spiegel rsquo recent keynote AXS Partner Summit hope Snapchat continues succeed bringing ideas mainstream All need Google wake actually innovate Plus rsquo ll truly party The time reimagining modern identity finally come I think people often found startup wrong reason Not due ulterior motive rsquo see alternative For

daily rsquo stand slow websites especially one I control 2 site operated shoe string budget quite large even small changes result savings worth investigating To end rsquo ve done best adhere best practices One thing YSlow PageSpeed complained years rsquo ve served static content cookied domain adding unnecessary request overhead If rsquo ve linked directly Facebook photo may noticed domain wasn facebook com instead something like fbcdn x x akamaihd net Large sites load static content special domains reasons primarily reduce request overhead sometimes security So recently switched static domains 4chan org 4cdn org resulting one large improvement one small side benefit First small side benefit When considering domain use I option choosing longer domain ie images 4chan cdn org shorter one ie 4cdn org The average page may 125 links difference page size two around 50 bytes compressed 50 bytes may seem like lot rsquo re serving 500 million pageviews per month adds This small change save us 23 gigabytes transfer per month 275 GB course year The larger savings realized users Despite best keep cookie size use Google Analytics puts average user rsquo cookie size around 1 kilobyte Because cookies sent every request made content hosted 4chan org average user must send 4chan roughly 100 KB data per page load receive response On mobile networks users home internet data caps significant By migrating new domain end users save roughly 100 KB upstream per page load 500 million pageviews per month adds 46 terabytes per month savings users I find unreal Are optimizations first place start No certainly reason made exhausted almost every page performance trick But scale large sites like 4chan especially run shoe string budget rsquo important remember little things
